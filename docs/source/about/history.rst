``baseobject`` was started in May 2022 by Franz Kir√°ly and Ryan Kuhns
in order to make it easier for others to use `scikit-learn`_ and `sktime`_
design principles in a range of projects.

Development is supported by the original project
members, new core developers and the broader community (see
`contributors <contributors.md>`_).

If you are interested in contributing, check out our
:ref:`Contributing <contrib_guide>` guide.
