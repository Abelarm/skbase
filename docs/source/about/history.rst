``baseobject`` was started in May 2022 by Franz Király and Ryan Kuhns
in order to make it easier for others to use `scikit-learn`_ and `sktime`_
design principles in a range of projects.

The project draws on their experiences working on `sktime`_ (where Franz Király is
a Community Council member and project cofounder and Ryan Kuhns was a
former core developer). It also builds on and was heavily inspired by
`scikti-learn's <scikit-learn-about>`_ `BaseEstimator API <scikit-learn-est>`_
as part of its API.

Development is supported by the original project
members, new core developers and the broader community (see
`contributors <contributors.md>`_).
