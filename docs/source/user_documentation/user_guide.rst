User Guide
==========

Welcome to ``baseobject's`` user guide!

The purpose of the user guide is to provide further explanations and context
to developers who want to use ``baseobject`` to help create their own
packages.

If your just looking for a technical specification of the functionality
that ``baseobject`` provides, see the :ref:`api_ref`.

.. note::

    The user guide is under development. We have created a basic
    structure and are looking for contributions to develop the user guide
    further.
