Enhancement Proposals
=====================

Description
===========

A ``skbase`` enhancement proposal (BEP) is a software design document
providing information to the ``skbase`` community.
The proposal should provide a rationale and concise technical specification of
the proposed design.

We intend BEPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing major changes,
for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design
decisions that have gone into ``skbase``.

Smaller changes will be discussed and implemented directly on issues and pull requests.

Submitting a BEP
================

To create a new BEP, please copy and use sktime's `template`_ (update any
references to sktime when drafting your BEP) and open a pull request on
the ``skbase`` repository.

.. _template: https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/blob/main/TEMPLATE.md

It is highly recommended that a single BEP contains a single key proposal or new idea.
The more focused the proposal, the more successful it tends to be.
If in doubt, split your BEP into several well-focused ones.

A BEP should be a consolidated document, including:

* a concise problem statement,
* a clear description of the proposed solution,
* a comparison with alternative solutions.
